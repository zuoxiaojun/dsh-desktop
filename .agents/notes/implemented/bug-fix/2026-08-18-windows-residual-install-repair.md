# Agent Note: Windows residual installation repair

Status: implemented

## Problem

A user can delete an installed Desktop directory or encounter an incomplete legacy uninstall while the per-user installation and uninstall registry entries remain. The next NSIS installer then attempts to invoke a missing or unusable old uninstaller. Electron Builder reports the repeated failure with its generic application-cannot-close dialog even after every Desktop process has stopped, so retrying cannot repair the installation.

## Decision

The Windows installer closes the application and its owned process tree before inspecting the registered installation. A missing application executable, a missing uninstaller, or a registered `0.1.0-rc.5` through `0.1.0-rc.9` preview identifies a repairable installation only when the registered path ends in the dedicated `DeepSeek Harness` directory. The installer then removes that application directory and the two stale uninstall commands before Electron Builder runs its old-version step. The normal payload extraction recreates the directory and complete uninstall registration. Profile, workspace, credentials, and plugin data remain outside the application directory.

## Verification

Packaging configuration coverage pins the dedicated-directory check, incomplete-file detection, affected preview range, residual removal, and uninstall-command cleanup. The native Windows lifecycle workflow installs and launches the packaged Host, preserves the registry while deleting the application directory, runs the same installer again, launches the repaired Host, and completes a running uninstall.

## Alternatives considered

**Tell every user to delete the directory or run `taskkill` manually.** Rejected because it requires technical recovery steps for a state the installer can identify and repair safely.

**Delete every registered installation path unconditionally.** Rejected because a damaged or unexpected registry path must not authorize recursive removal outside the dedicated product directory.

**Only overwrite files without removing the residue.** Rejected because locked, incompatible, or partially removed legacy files can survive an overlay and leave the new payload inconsistent.

## Consequences

Broken per-user preview installations recover through the ordinary guided installer without Task Manager, PowerShell, or manual AppData cleanup. Repair deliberately removes every file inside the dedicated application directory; it does not remove user Profile data, but files manually placed inside the program directory are not retained.
